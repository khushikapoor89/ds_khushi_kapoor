Web3 Trading – Data Science Assignment
Candidate: Khushi Kapoor

Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment
(Fear & Greed Index) and trader behavior using historical trading data
from Hyperliquid. The goal is to understand how profitability and
trading volume vary under different market emotions.

Datasets Used
- Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index
- Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid

Methodology
- Cleaned and preprocessed both datasets
- Converted timestamps to date format
- Merged trader data with daily market sentiment
- Performed sentiment-wise aggregation and visualization
- Analyzed profitability and trading volume trends

Key Insights
- Trades executed during Greed phases show higher average profitability
- Fear phases exhibit higher trading volume, indicating aggressive or
  panic-driven trading behavior
- Extreme Greed phases show reduced returns due to overconfidence

Project Structure
- notebook_1.ipynb: Data analysis and visualization (via Google Colab)
- csv_files: CSV datasets (lightweight files only)
- outputs: Generated charts and visualizations
- ds_report.pdf: Final summarized insights

Data Note
The historical trading dataset and merged dataset exceed GitHub’s
25MB file size limit and are therefore not uploaded.
All preprocessing, merging, and analysis can be fully reproduced
using the shared Google Colab notebook link.
